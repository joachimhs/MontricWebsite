            <h1>About</h1>

            <p>Montric is an Open Source Application Monitoring Tool. As opposed to other profiling and application
                monitoring solutions, Montric goes out of its way in order to stay out of your existing Metric-gathering
                toolchain.</p>

            <p>In a sense, Montric is Metric-source agnostic. This means that if you can measure it, you can monitor it
                with Montric! Montric accept metrics via a standard HTTP POST, via its JSON-based API. Once the data has
                been received by Montric, we won't lock you down to our services, and we wont impose a workflow on you
                either. You can just as easily fetch your metrics back, either as-is or aggregated and use this data in
                any way you'd like. This adheres to Montrics key goal, to be a truly Open Source solution from end to
                end.</p>

            <h1>Private Beta</h1>

            <p>Montric will be entering private beta very soon! If you are interested in participating in the beta
